**A fantasy world with limited magitek in the form of trains and airships**
# Society
- Few countries exist today, most of the world is populated by independent settlements or city-states
- The world has a long history of nations and empires rising and falling, no one ever expects them to last long nor do many care who claims
their sovereignty
## Organizations
WIP
## Religion
- Humanity worships the 188 Gods of War
- All deities relate to violence/warfare in someway
- Freedom of religion is a universal understanding (Still gods do have rivalries and enemies between each other)
- Organized religion usually takes of the form of schools/dojos where specific teachings of certain major/minor gods are taught;
miniscule gods usually do not have an organized following
### World Tournament
- Organized by the gods on a yearly(?) basis
- The winner is invited to live in a heavenly utopia created by the gods where only other past winners live
- Located on the island in the (Yet named) sea
## Magic
- Magic is given to humans through divine grace based on whom they worship/study
- Magic powers are always related to combat in someway
# Denizens
- The World is populated by Humans, Gods, Monsters (Different name for monster?), and Earth life
- Humanity created the gods through force of will in order to fullfil their desires; new gods are no longer created (At least as often) 
because enough deities exists to cover most of the desires of humans
- Gods created monsters because they can
- Monsters can be anything from mindless predators to sentient beings
